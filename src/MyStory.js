        My name is Candy, and I have advanced chronic angle-closure glaucoma. In
        2021 I suffered an acute-angle closure attack at the age of 32. For a
        few months nothing could contol my IOP. At one point I was a few days
        away from loosing my vision in my right eye completely. Things got
        really scary, really quickly. I turned to the internet for support, but
        found almost no resources for either angle-closure or glaucoma in people
        under 40. I spent the first 6 months after diagnosis studying the
        disease so I could make educated decisions on my treatment. I'm now on a
        mission to share my journey, and everything I found along the way. I
        hope to create a place where others (particularly those that fall
        outside the usual bracket for glaucoma) can feel more supported,
        understood and less alone on their own journey.
